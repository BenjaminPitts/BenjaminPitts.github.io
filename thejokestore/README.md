The Joke Store

This is my first portfolio project that I created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. First, I made a 'carousel of Dads' to be a visual aid in deploying a 'dad' joke. I also included some tooltips that are specific to each Dad. Next, I linked an API to append jokes into an empty div when a button is clicked. I also created a button to save a 'go-to' joke in the user's local storage
and retrieve that joke from the browser at any point.
Finally, I linked a 2nd API that uses the value of a form field to output several
weather conditions. Some 'Dad phrases' are also displayed and are specific to the
user's current local temperature. <br><br>
