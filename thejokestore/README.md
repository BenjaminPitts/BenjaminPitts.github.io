The Joke Store

This is my first portfolio project that I created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
JSON, and jQuery. First, I made a carousel of Dads to be a visual aid in deploying a
joke. I also included some tooltips that are specific to each Dad. Next, I linked
an API to append jokes into an empty div when a button is clicked. I also
created a button to save a 'go-to' joke in the local storage
and retrieve the joke at any point in time, even if the browser is refreshed.
Finally, I linked a 2nd API that uses the value of a form field to output several
weather conditions. Some 'Dad phrases' are also displayed and are specific to the 
current local temperature.
