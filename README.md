The Joke Store

This is my first portfolio project and I am building an app using html, css, javaScript,
and an external API to manipulate the DOM. I am using Ajax to access 'JokeAPI' and 'open weather map API'.
I am using a carousel to scroll through images and buttons to filter by joke type. I am also using a tooltip to display text each time the cursor hovers over an image. For the weather API, I have a form field where the user can input a city or state and it will return 4 different weather categories. Finally, I am working on a way to save a favorite joke to the page using local storage.
