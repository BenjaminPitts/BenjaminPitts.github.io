The Joke Store

This is my first portfolio project and I am building an app using html, css, javaScript,
and an external API to manipulate the DOM. I am using Ajax to access 'JokeAPI'
which is free and simple but works fairly well and provides what I need for
this project. I am using a carousel to scroll through images and buttons to
filter by joke type. I am also using a tooltip to display text each time the cursor hovers
over an image.
